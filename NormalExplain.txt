Normalization Explanation: 

Movies Table: 
1NF: Each piece of data (title, release_year, genre, etc.) is stored in its own column—no lists or combined data.
2NF: All columns (like title, release_year, genre, director) depend on the movie_id. The whole row is about that one movie, identified by movie_id.
3NF: The columns don’t depend on each other—only on movie_id. For example, the director doesn’t depend on the genre, just on which movie it is.

Customers Table:
1NF: Each piece of customer info (first_name, last_name, email, etc.) is in its own column.
2NF: All the details (like first name, email, etc.) depend entirely on the customer_id. If you know the customer ID, you know all the other details.
3NF: None of the columns depend on each other—only on the customer_id. The phone number doesn’t rely on the email, just on which customer it is

Rentals Table:
1NF: Each piece of rental info (rental date, return date, etc.) is in its own column.
2NF: All details (like rental date) depend entirely on the rental_id (which rental it is).
3NF: The columns don’t depend on each other. The movie and customer info are connected through IDs, not through each other directly.
